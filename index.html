        <div id="paragraph-1" class="paragraph-1">
            <h1>What is an online whiteboard?</h1>
            <p>Onlineboard is a free online drawing board that runs in your web browser. You do not need to install any additional software on your device to use it.
                 It is conceptually similar to a physical whiteboard. First, you need to create a new whiteboard. <br><br>

                 An online whiteboard is a canvas that you can share with your colleagues or friends. You can share the whiteboard by sending them the URL address of your whiteboard. 
                 They can join your session by simply opening the link in a web browser. They do not have to register or log in to collaborate with you. <br><br>
                 
                 With registered account you can limit whether your colleagues or audience can also draw on the whiteboard or whether they can only look. You can see their cursors even in read-only mode.</p>

            <h1>How does collaboration with web whiteboard work?</h1>
            <p>When they open your whiteboard, they can see the same stuff as you. When you draw something, your collaborators can see it too. 
                You also see their drawings. It is similar to the concept of online text processors such as Word Online or Google Sheets. But instead of working on a text document together, you have your big shared canvas.</p>
            

        </div>
        <div id="paragraph-2" class="paragraph-1">
            <h1>Which devices are supported?</h1>
            <p>The main device we expect our users to use when using our whiteboard is a desktop computer or laptop. These devices have bigger screens which makes it inherently easier and more comfortable for using a whiteboard. <br><br>

                We also greatly values users with tablets and graphical tablets. We fully support common gestures and touch input. We also periodically test our application with common graphical tablets such as XPPen, Wacom and stylues such as Apple Pen or S Pen so that they are easily usable with our whiteboard. <br><br>
                
                And at last are the phone users. While we strive to have the online board working on these devices their small screens makes them problematic to use. Onlineboard is fully supported on modern Android phones, Apple Phones and other devices. You may just have better experience with using a tablet or a desktop computer.</p>

            <h1>How hard is Onlineboard to use?</h1>
            <p>The user interface of Onlineboard is simple to use and has several functionalities. One of the most important ones is the brush and eraser tools. You can use these tools to draw and write on the shared whiteboard. The whiteboard also supports the undo command, which removes the last drawing. <br><br>
                An online whiteboard is a practical tool because it allows participants to collaborate interactively. It is like sharing a screen during a video conference but with a superpower. The cursors of everyone are shared and can be used as a marker tool when discussing something written on the whiteboard. <br><br>

                The other advantage is that the online whiteboard is a specialized application, so it runs more smoothly than screen sharing in a conference calling software. Less technical difficulties, more collaboration! <br><br>
                
                If you have any difficulties while working with Onlineboard refer to our manual which contains easy to follow tutorials and reference for every functionality. If that still doesn't help you do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
            
            <h1>Can I take my drawings out of Onlineboard?</h1>
            <p>You can export your drawings into a PNG file and save them on your computer or upload them to your favorite cloud. When you log in to Onlineboard, we will automatically save your boards to your account. You can return to them later and continue working on them. You can also organize your boards by renaming them and categorizing them with the help of tags.</p>
